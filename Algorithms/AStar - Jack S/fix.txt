Replaced the following lines:

            for node in oList.itemList:
                if child == node and child.g > node.g:
                    #print(child.pos, node.pos)
                    continue
                elif child == node and child.g <= node.g:
                    del oList.itemList[currentIndex]
                    currentIndex -= 1
                    continue
                currentIndex += 1
				
				
with:

            for currentIndex in range(0, oList.getLen()):
                try:
                    node = oList.itemList[currentIndex]
                except IndexError:
                    break
                if child == node and child.g > node.g:
                    continue
                elif child == node and child.g <= node.g:
                    del oList.itemList[currentIndex]
                    currentIndex -= 1
                    continue
					
Original resulted in the node that got deleted being different to the one that was selected
